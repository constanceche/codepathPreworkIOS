App Idea: Finflow - Expense Tracking App
  This app is designed as a comprehensive expense tracking and budget management tool, aimed at simplifying personal finance for users. It features an expense categorization system, which sorts expenditures into predefined or custom categories such as groceries, utilities, and dining, making it easy to track and analyze spending habits. Users can also set and monitor budgets across different categories, with tracking to ensure they stay on top of their financial goals. Additionally, the app will create visual analytics to give an overview of patterns through graphs to give users gain insights into their financial habits. The app will also includes bill reminders and alerts for upcoming bills or subscriptions to keep users informed and prepared for their financial commitments.
